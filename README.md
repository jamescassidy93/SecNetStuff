# SecNetStuff
This repo will hold code to simplify common work tasks. It will have a helper GUI application that will act as a container to automate most of the actual work, which are separate python modules.

Currently, the developed modules are as described:
- SecNetGUIApp: helper GUI made using guizero
- SecNetNmapShortcuts: common Nmap commands, plus scripts to generate HTML from Nmap outputs 
- SecNetPcapStuff: common pcap/CSV manipulation

This repo is a work-in-progress.
